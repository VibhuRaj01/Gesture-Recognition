# Real-time Thumbs Up/Down Detection using YOLOv8

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for real-time thumbs-up and thumbs-down detection using the YOLOv8 model. It's an exciting application of computer vision that has a wide range of uses in gesture recognition systems.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the detection on a webcam feed, use the following command:
```bash
python inference.py
```
